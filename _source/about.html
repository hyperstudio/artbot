            <p>Discover art in in and around Boston!</p>

			<p>Artbot encourages meaningful, sustained relationships to art through the discovery of local cultural happenings. We combine human and bot curators to find, organize, and connect events at different institutions around Boston, with the goal of helping you find new art tailored to your interests.</p>

			<p>Now in beta, Artbot currently shares information about events and exhibitions at the deCordova Museum, Harvard Art Museums, Institute of Contemporary Art, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, MIT List Visual Arts Center, Museum of Fine Arts, Peabody Essex Museum, and Rose Art Museum.</p>

			<p>Artbot was developed at <a href="http://hyperstudio.mit.edu">HyperStudio</a>, the digital humanities laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Our goal is to inject fresh, unconventional, and playful connections between cultural events, to help audiences serendipitously discover new art.</p>
